##What
We are going to solve the Broken Window problem in Tacoma. 

Broken Window Theory (wikipedia)
The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.

##How
We are going to build a web app that allow users to upload images of graffiti, vandalism etc. Once the image is uploaded our app will then pin it on a map to give us a visual of problem areas in Tacoma. With this information we can then dispatch a volutneer team or the city to fix the issue.  

##Where/ When (Hackathon)
Next Hackathon date and time is TBD, check back soon, click [here](https://sites.google.com/a/hacktacoma.org/home/home/gallery) for highlights of the last hackathon.

##Project Needs
This will be a comprehensive project. We need people to fill many positions. We will have teams for every aspect of this project. The following is a list of teams we need filled.

####Developers :computer:
A core team of developers. Skills we are looking for are HTML, CSS, Javascript, iOS (Swift | Obj-C), backend and frontend engineers.

####Designers/ Artist :art:
A team of UX/UI designers for the client facing side. Also we need logos, art and color templates.

####Einsteins :bulb:
Are you good at math, are you a GIS student or are you just an all round smart person. We will need problem solvers and critical thinkers.

####Content Writers :pencil:
HackTacoma needs its about page written. Teams need bios. If you are a writer and want to write about this event or if you want to write the documentation for this project come join us.

####Social Media :trollface:
Are you a social media guru? HackTacoma needs a team to help grow its online presence. The team will also be responsible for covering the 24 hour event on snapchat, periscope, twitter etc.

####Video/ Actors/ Actresses :tv:
We are going to make a quick 90 second commercial and upload it to youtube. We need a video team and participants willing to act.

####Photographers :camera:
Someone needs to capture this event right? This team will be responsible for capturing this event and posting their work to this project.

####Music :musical_note:
We will need to fill the silence somehow. If you are a dj (bring your setup, serato, numark, technics) or play an instrument come down and play. Help keep people entertained while they take a break. 

####Instructors :mortar_board:
Not everyone is going to know how to use Git or Markdown. We will need at least one person willing to teach others how to use these tools.

####Food :pizza: :cookie: :fries:
Help feed the team! We won't be serving typical premade food like :fries: and :pizza:. Fresh food will be cooked on site to create a more open and personal atmosphere, so if you are interested in cooking or serving come on down. We appreciate those who help with ingredients as well :smile:. 

####Green Team/ Volunteers :thumbsup:
If you just want to learn what its like to build an app or join this project we have room for you. We will be needing a hand setting up and cleaning too. Don't be afraid, who knows you might end up contributing a great idea!

##Why Should you Join?
By joining you will have the opportunity to learn and gain hands on experience. Remember any contributions you make will be tracked in Git. This is a great way to build a portfolio and add to your resume. Having any contributions on an open source project, especially for a city, looks really good to any future employer.
