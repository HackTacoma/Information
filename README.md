##What
We are going to solve the Broken Window problem in Tacoma. 

Broken Window Theory (wikipedia)
The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.

##How
We are going to build a web app that allow users to upload images of graffiti, vandalism etc. Once the image is uploaded our app will then pin it on a map to give us a visual of problem areas in Tacoma. With this information we can then dispatch a volutneer team or the city to fix the issue.
